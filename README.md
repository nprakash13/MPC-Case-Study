# MPC-Case-Study - Nagaraj Prakash, Prathamesh Kolekar, Srinidhi Subbanna
Comparision of MPC and Override Control for Level control problem. We have used a process simulation on Honeywell's Unisim as our plant. The override control strategy is developed in Unisim and the MPC is developed using DO-MPC library in Python. This repository contains everything to reproduce our experiments and the detailed instructions on hot to run the project can be found in the Project Report.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 (32-bit, as OPC DA is not supported in 64-bit Python)
- Numpy
- CasADi
- Matplotlib
- PDB
- sys
- DO-MPC
- os
- pywintypes
- time
- OpenOPC
- Honeywell Unisim R451
- Matricon OPC server for simulation and testing (OPC DA)
- Matricon OPC explorer (OPC DA)
